### HTML and CSS

1. **What are semantic elements in HTML5? Why are they important?**
   - Semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, and `<article>` provide meaning to the content they wrap, making it easier for search engines, screen readers, and developers to understand the structure and purpose of the content. They improve accessibility and SEO.

2. **Explain the CSS Box Model.**
   - The CSS Box Model consists of content, padding, border, and margin around each HTML element. It dictates how these elements are sized and spaced relative to other elements on the page. Understanding the Box Model is crucial for layout and spacing in web development.

3. **What is the difference between `inline` and `block` elements in CSS? Give examples of each.**
   - **Inline elements:** Flow inline with the surrounding content and do not start on a new line. Examples include `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`.
   - **Block elements:** Occupy the full width available and start on a new line. Examples include `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`.

### Bootstrap

1. **Explain the grid system in Bootstrap and how it helps in responsive web design.**
   - Bootstrap's grid system is based on a 12-column layout. It allows developers to create responsive layouts by defining column widths for different screen sizes (e.g., extra small, small, medium, large). It simplifies creating responsive designs without writing custom CSS.

2. **What are the advantages of using Bootstrap for front-end development?**
   - Bootstrap provides a responsive grid system, pre-styled components (buttons, forms, navigation bars), extensive documentation, and cross-browser compatibility. It speeds up development by offering ready-to-use components and reduces the need for custom CSS.

### Interview Questions for UI Developers

1. **How do you approach responsive web design?**
   - **Answer:** I use a mobile-first approach, starting with the smallest screen size and adding styles for larger screens using media queries. I leverage Bootstrap's grid system and CSS flexbox/grid for layout. I test responsiveness using browser developer tools and real devices.

2. **Can you explain CSS specificity and how it affects styling in web development?**
   - **Answer:** CSS specificity determines which CSS rule is applied to an element when multiple rules could apply. It's calculated based on the selector's type (inline, ID, class, element) and order in the stylesheet. Understanding specificity helps avoid style conflicts and ensures styles are applied correctly.


### Bootstrap

1. **Explain how Bootstrap grid system works.**
   - Bootstrap’s grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. It’s based on a 12-column grid, where content is placed within columns and columns are placed within rows.
